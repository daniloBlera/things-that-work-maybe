List mode, for visualization of what would be invisible otherwise.

```text
tab	separated	words
	this line starts with one tab

        this line starts with eight whitespaces
6      3   4    5     7       8        9         whitespaces
ten trailing whitespaces:          
two trailing whitespaces, a tab, and a single whitespace:

pretty ligatures in code (and terminal)

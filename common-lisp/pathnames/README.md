# pathnames

Just some small path-related utilities based on the
implementations from the [Practical Common Lisp][pcl] book.

## Usage

Copy this directory and its contents under
`~/.local/share/common-lisp` or
`$ROSWELL_HOME/local-projects` if using the [Roswell][ros]
setup utility. After that, this library can be loaded with
quicklisp.
